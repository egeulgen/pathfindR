\description{
A dataset containing the differentially-expressed genes and adjusted p-values
for the GEO dataset GSE99393. The RNA microarray experiment was perform to
detail the global program of gene expression underlying polarization of
myeloma-associated macrophages by CSF1R antibody treatment. The samples were
6 murine bone marrow derived macrophages co-cultured with myeloma cells
(myeloma-associated  macrophages), 3 of which were treated with CSF1R
antibody (treatment group) and the rest were treated with control IgG
antibody (control group). In this dataset, differentially-expressed genes
with |logFC| >= 2 and FDR < 0.05 are presented.
