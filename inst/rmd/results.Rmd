pathfindR-Enrichment results are presented below:

## [All terms found to be enriched](./enriched_terms.html)
A table that lists all terms found to be enriched as well as lists of up- or down-regulated genes for each term. If it was requested, the term descriptions are linked to the visualizations of these terms, where affected color genes are colored by change values (if provided).

## [Tables of genes with converted gene symbols and genes without interactions](./conversion_table.html)
- A table listing the genes whose symbols (Old Symbol) were converted to aliases (Converted Symbol) that were in the protein-protein interaction network.
- A table listing the input genes for which no interactions in the PIN were found (after the aliases were also checked).
